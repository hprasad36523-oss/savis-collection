# 🛍️ AURA | Premium Telegram-Managed Streetwear Store

AURA is an ultra-modern, glassmorphic clothing catalog website built using **Vite + React (Frontend)** and **Node.js Express (Backend)**, synchronized in real-time with a **Telegram Bot** for store inventory management.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

- **Vite + React Frontend:** Premium glassmorphic storefront featuring a catalog, categories, product details modal, cart drawer, checkout forms, and an interactive simulated Telegram bot phone preview.
- **Express.js API Backend:** Exposes REST routes for products and order submissions, serves static assets (clothing images), and initializes the long-polling Telegram Bot manager.
- **Telegram Bot Manager:** A conversational agent that parses photo uploads and metadata inputs to live-register clothing items directly into the shared JSON database.

## ⚡ Quick Start (Windows)

We have provided an automated launcher script `run.bat` at the root of the project. 

1. Double-click **`run.bat`** (or execute it in your terminal):
   ```cmd
   .\run.bat
   ```
2. Two command shell windows will spawn:
   - One running the **Express API & Telegram Bot** at `http://localhost:5000`
   - One running the **Vite React Web Server** at `http://localhost:5173`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the premium storefront.

## 🤖 Telegram Bot Configuration (Owner Guide)

To manage your clothing catalog and receive notifications when orders are placed, connect your custom Telegram Bot:

### Step 1: Create a Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
2. Send the command `/newbot` and follow the instructions.
3. Copy the **API Token** provided (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`).

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. Open `backend/.env` in your editor.
2. Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your copied token:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ
   ```
3. Restart the backend server. The console monitor will log:
   `[BOT] Telegram Bot polling active. Listening for commands.`

### Step 3: Register as Store Administrator
1. Search for your bot in Telegram and click **Start** or send `/start`.
2. Send the command `/auth`.
3. The bot will respond:
   `👑 Authorized! You are now registered as a store administrator.`

## 📱 Bot Commands for Catalog Management

Once authorized, you can manage the store directly from your phone:

- **`/addproduct`**: Triggers a guided multi-step configuration:
  1. *Send Photo:* Upload the clothing image. The backend downloads it directly to server storage.
  2. *Set Name:* Input product name (e.g. *Retro Varsity Bomber*).
  3. *Set Description:* Input copy text.
  4. *Set Price:* Input numerical price (e.g. *149.00*).
  5. *Set Category:* Input category (e.g. *Outerwear*).
  - *The item is immediately visible on the website!*
- **`/list`**: View all listed items with their unique IDs and prices.
- **`/delete <product_id>`**: Remove a product from the database and clean up the image file.
- **`/orders`**: Review the 10 most recent customer checkout logs.
- **`Order Alerts`**: When a buyer fills out the checkout drawer and clicks "Confirm & Place Order", the bot instantly messages all authorized administrators with the customer details, shipping address, and itemized checkout receipt!
